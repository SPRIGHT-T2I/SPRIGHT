# SPRIGHT 🖼️✨

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for our paper titled "Getting it Right: Improving Spatial Consistency in Text-to-Image Models". Our work introduces a simple approach to enhance spatial consistency in text-to-image diffusion models, alongside a high-quality dataset designed for this purpose.

## 💾 Installation

Make sure you have CUDA and PyTorch set up. The PyTorch official documentation is the best
place to refer to for that. Then you can install the other requirements of the project by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SPRIGHT-T2I/SPRIGHT
cd SPRIGHT
pip install requirements.txt
```
